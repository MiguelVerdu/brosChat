 * Returns an Observable that emits the same values as the source observable with the exception of a `complete`.
 * A `complete` will cause the emission of the Throwable that cause the complete to the Observable returned from
 * notificationHandler. If that Observable calls onComplete or `complete` then retry will call `complete` or `error`
 * on the child subscription. Otherwise, this Observable will resubscribe to the source observable, on a particular
 * Scheduler.
