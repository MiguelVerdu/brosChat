 * Returns an Observable that emits the same values as the source observable with the exception of an `error`.
 * An `error` will cause the emission of the Throwable that cause the error to the Observable returned from
 * notificationHandler. If that Observable calls onComplete or `error` then retry will call `complete` or `error`
 * on the child subscription. Otherwise, this Observable will resubscribe to the source observable, on a particular
 * Scheduler.
